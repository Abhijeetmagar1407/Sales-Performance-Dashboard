# power-bi-sales-dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data using Power BI to support data-driven business decisions. An interactive dashboard was developed to track revenue, sales trends, product performance, and regional analysis.

The project involved creating DAX measures, using slicers and KPIs, and designing clear visualizations to identify top-performing products, high-revenue regions, and sales gaps. The dashboard enables users to dynamically filter data and gain quick insights into overall business performance.
